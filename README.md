"content": "Sure, here is a simple example of a Python for loop:

    ```python
    # This loop will print numbers from 0 to 9
    # for i in range(10):
    #     print(i)
    ```
    #
    # In this example, `range(10)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 9. The `for` loop then iterates over this sequence, assigning each number in turn to the variable `i` and executing the code inside the loop.",
